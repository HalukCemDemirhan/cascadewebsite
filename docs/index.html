          <h2>I. Agency Without Accountability</h2>
          <p>
            Artificial intelligence has fundamentally expanded what systems can do, yet deployment in mission-critical environments remains out of reach. The bottleneck is not performance—it’s trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Agentic systems can operate at scales and speeds impossible for human oversight, unlocking efficiency across every domain requiring judgment, adaptation, and decision-making. But without infrastructure to verify their reasoning, detect failures, and validate alignment, we cannot grant the autonomy their capabilities demand.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
          <h2>II. The Stochastic Foundation</h2>
          <p>
            Traditional software is built deterministically—logic can be audited, execution traced, outcomes predicted. Security meant controlling inputs and constraining permissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Agentic systems are fundamentally different. Built on stochastic foundations—probabilistic, emergent, irreducible to simple rules—they appear to reason through weighted possibilities. Security paradigms for deterministic systems fail here. Threat vectors are dynamic, hidden in reasoning processes. Protecting stochastic systems demands semantic understanding of those processes; static proxies are no longer sufficient.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
          <h2>III. Transparency as Security Infrastructure</h2>
          <p>
            If agents are to operate in mission-critical environments—healthcare, finance, and domains where failure is unacceptable—visibility cannot be an afterthought. It must be the foundation of security.
          </p>
          <p>
            AI security demands continuous, structured observation: tracing reasoning paths, mapping semantic topologies of decisions, detecting drift, anomalies, manipulation, and misalignment as they emerge. Transparency is not supplementary; it is foundational.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
          <h2>The Reliability Threshold</h2>
          <p>
            We stand at an inflection point. Agentic systems have crossed the capability frontier yet fall short of the security requirements needed for real deployment. Until we observe their reasoning, verify safety, detect adversarial behavior, and trust decisions under uncertainty, we cannot deploy them where they matter most.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe safety for agentic systems is the tipping point for true AI adoption.
